# Todo application (which uses SQL)
This is intended to be a full stack todo application. The technologies used will include: Angular (for the front end), Express (for the backend) and SQL (for the storage of data). Moreover, it is intended to demonstrate my knowledge of 'Auth and Auth' (using jsonwebtoken) as well as how to store passwords securely in a database (using bcryptjs and pg).
